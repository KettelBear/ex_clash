## Disclaimer

This material is unofficial and is not endorsed by Supercell. For more
information see Supercell's Fan Content
[Policy](https://www.supercell.com/fan-content-policy).

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `ex_clash` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_clash, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Dependencies

* HTTP requests are made using [Req](https://hexdocs.pm/req/readme.html).
* Due to the aforementioned dependency, this library requires the use of at
  least Elixir `v1.12` or newer. At time of building, Elixir `v1.16` was used.
* A developer account at https://developer.clashofclans.com/ is required so you
  can acquire An [API Token](https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/new-key) for
  authorized use of Supercell's API.

## Features

* Add your token to any `[ENV].secret.exs` and start using this library.
    ```elixir
    config :ex_clash, token: "YOUR SUPER SECRET TOKEN"
    ```
* Get well-defined structs back from responses instead of parsing maps with
  string keys.
* HTTP functions are available to make your own API requests. Just use
  `ExClash.HTTP.get/2` which will handle auth, the url, and query params for
  you.
* Not sure if feature; this library is not going to tell you if you got a
  parameter wrong in your `Keyword` list. It'll just forward it along to `Req`
  to consume, who will just attach it as a query param and Supercell's API
  will ignore it. ðŸ¤·

### Player specific information

### Esports related APIs

Currently, Supercell does not have any Esports related API endpoints.
I'm including this category here because they have the category in their
developer portal.
